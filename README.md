# Chess
## Description
Welcome to my attempt at recreating the game of chess! I will try to use my knowledge from a class I took on object-oriented programming and apply it to creating a game on Java. This project, at the moment, will be broken down into the following phases:
1. Creating the chess board with the ability to place pieces on the board in valid positions
2. Using inheritance, create all possible chess pieces with their movement patterns
3. Apply exception handling to ensure each piece can complete valid moves and attack valid pieces
4. Recreate a playable game of chess
5. Apply save states
