# Chess
## Description
Welcome to my attempt at recreating the game of chess! I will try to use my knowledge from a class I took on object-oriented programming and apply it to creating a game on Java. This project, at the moment, will be broken down into the following phases:
1. Creating the chess board with the ability to place pieces on the board in valid positions - Completed December 30, 2023
2. Using inheritance, create all possible chess pieces with their movement patterns - Completed December 30, 2023
3. Ensure each piece can complete valid moves and attack valid pieces - Completed January 4th, 2024
4. Recreate a playable game of chess
5. Apply save states

## How to Play (as of January 5, 2024)
1. Run Main to display the game board
2. Press and hold piece you wish to move with a right-mouse click
3. Move piece in a valid movement pattern and release mouse right-click (If pattern for movement or attack are invalid you will be prompted with an "Invalid Move" prompt)
4. To reset board stop and re-run Main
