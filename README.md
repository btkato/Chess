# model.Chess
## Description
Welcome to my attempt at recreating the game of chess! I will try to use my knowledge from a class I took on object-oriented programming and apply it to creating a game on Java. This project, at the moment, will be broken down into the following phases:
1. Creating the chess board with the ability to place pieces on the board in valid positions - Completed December 30, 2023
2. Using inheritance, create all possible chess pieces with their movement patterns - Completed December 30, 2023
3. Ensure each piece can complete valid moves and attack valid pieces - Completed January 4th, 2024
4. Recreate a playable game of chess
5. Apply save states
